# Design your Item

Before you start modifying the source files to add your item to the game you should first come up clear idea for your item. You should consider the following attributes for the item:

- What benefits will it provide? (e.g. increase damage, fire rate, health, etc)
- At what cost to stats will it provide the benefit? (e.g. large increase in fire rate, but lowers damage per blast)
- What price should it be listed at in the store? (Items should be priced according to their net benefit)

Once you have an idea for each of the points listed above, you should be ready to start implementing your item. However, if you have ideas for the presentation of the item in the game you can come up with those now too. This includes:

- What will the item be called? Try keeping your item's name consistent with space_shooter_rs's sci-fi/cosmic-horror theme.
- What will the item look like? The item should like like a visual representation of the name you gave it. Refer to the section for [items]() in contributing art.

## Example Item

I want to create an item that will:

- Provide a substantial increase in fire rate.
- The increase in fire rate will come at the cost of some damage per blast.
- This item will cost $8 from the store.

This item will be called "Frequency Augmentor" because it sounds sci-fi-y and somewhat relates to what the items does.
The item will look like this:
