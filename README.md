# Space Shooter

# Project Introduction

This game was made with the [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/) engine. It is inspired by games like Raiden and The Binding of Isaac. Checkout my development journey on my [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtN5vL80u4Q&list=PL4Dmmk1VXA5p0tVmxNUr8j0ly5ERbL1hN) channel and my write-up about using Amethyst on my [website](https://micronote.tech/2019/06/Space-Shooter-Game/).

# Game Introduction

In this game you control a spaceship. Your goal is to defend an objective from the incoming invasion of enemy spaceships while not letting your health deplete in the process. You can shoot the enemies with your spaceships blasters or ram into them with your barrel roll dealing damage to yourself in the process. How long can you last?

# MVP Specification

**Inspirations**: Raiden, Binding of Isaac

**Genres**: Space shooter, Fantasy

**Plot**: Under discussion

## Setting

The universe starting at Earth.

## Camera

Stationary, focused on the play arena.

## Player Interaction

Player can move, shoot, barrel roll and use other special abilities and items.

## Game Mechanics

- The player controls a spaceship that can move, shoot, and barrel roll.
- The goal of the game is to defeat a final boss.
- The goal of any given level is to prevent enemies from getting to the bottom of the arena. Letting enemies get to the bottom of the arena will deplete the "defense" bar. The player must also not let their health bar be depleted.
- The player loses health if their ship collides with an enemy blast or an enemy spaceship.
- Each enemy type has a set amount of health that must be depleted to destroy them.
- Each level has several phases where each phase has some degree of random generation. (See Level Phases)
- Each level increases in difficulty.
- Meeting certain objectives will unlock more items.
- Enemies drop pickups and a currency which will need to be manually picked up by the player.

## Level Phases
A level features multiple phases. See example phase-map below.

Rest => Invasion => Rest => Mini-Game => Rest => Boss

In the "Invasion" phase an appropriately themed and appropriately difficult selection of enemies is chosen and total enemy count is determined. Enemies are then spawned at random from the selection and the player must deal with them until the number of enemies spawned reaches the total number of enemies for the level.

The "Mini-Game" phase will feature a challenge apart from shooting enemies. This could be something like a large amount of asteroids spawning which the player will need to dodge.

The "Boss" phase will feature a super tough enemy that will serve as the toughest challenge in the level. Defeating the boss ends the level.

The "Rest" phase will give the player a chance to rest and collect themselves before the next phase.
