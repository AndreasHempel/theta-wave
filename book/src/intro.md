# Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to the book for the Theta Wave game. It aims to serve
as the primary source of documentation for those interested in contributing to
a game using the [Amethyst game engine](https://amethyst.rs/).

This book is being actively updated. So there may be sections that are still
under construction.
