# Architecture

space_shooter_rs is made with the Amethyst game engine. This means that
the design methodology space_shooter_rs uses is ECS (Entity Component System).
This section will provide an overview of the Entities, Components, and Systems
present in space_shooter_rs. The aim here is to provide a resource for how
ECS is applied to this specific game. But it can also serve as an example of
what a game architecture using ECS could look like in practice.
