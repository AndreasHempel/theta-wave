# Theta Wave

## Project Introduction

This game was made with the [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/) engine. It is
inspired by games like Raiden and The Binding of Isaac. Checkout my development
journey on my [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtN5vL80u4Q&list=PL4Dmmk1VXA5p0tVmxNUr8j0ly5ERbL1hN)
channel and my write-up about using Amethyst on my [website](https://micronote.tech/2019/06/Space-Shooter-Game/).

## Game Introduction

In Theta Wave, you play as a spaceship defending an objective. The goal of the
game is to survive levels by destroying enemies, collecting consumables, buying
helpful things, and defeating the final boss.
